# pgdev - PostgreSQL Development Environment Manager

A command-line tool for creating, managing, and interacting with
multiple, isolated PostgreSQL development environments built from source.

***

## Introduction

**`pgdev`** is a tool designed to simplify the workflow of developers
working on PostgreSQL core or extensions. It automates the entire
process of setting up a development environment, from downloading and
compiling source code to initializing and running the database cluster.

The core philosophy of **`pgdev`** is to provide a flexible and powerful
build system without a rigid configuration framework. It uses simple,
executable shell scripts (`Blueprints`) and a self-contained directory
structure, giving you full control over the build process while
automating the tedious aspects of environment management.

***

## Core Concepts

The tool is built on a few simple but powerful concepts: a self-contained
directory structure, and a build system based on Blueprints and Templates.

### Directory Structure

**`pgdev`** uses a monolithic directory structure, keeping all tool files
and user-generated instances under a single `~/pgdev` directory. This
makes it easy to find all related files and manage the installation.

```

\~/pgdev/
â”œâ”€â”€ instances/              # User's database instances are created here
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pg17-main/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ install/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ logs/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ pgdev.conf
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ blueprints/             # User's personal, reusable blueprint scripts
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ .core/                  # The tool's internal installation files (hidden)
    â”œâ”€â”€ bin/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pgdev.sh        # The core logic in a portable bash script
    â”œâ”€â”€ shell/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pgdev.fish      # Wrapper and completions for fish shell
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pgdev.sh.env    # Script to be sourced for bash/zsh
    â””â”€â”€ templates/          # Default templates shipped with the tool
        â””â”€â”€ postgres-only/

````

### Blueprints and Templates

Instead of a rigid YAML or TOML file, the build process is defined by
**Blueprints**. A blueprint is a set of simple, executable shell
scripts for a *single component* (like PostgreSQL or an extension).
These scripts map to a component's lifecycle:
* **`.configure.sh`**: Clones the source and runs configuration.
* **`.build.sh`**: Compiles and installs the component.
* **`.test.sh`**: Runs the component's test suite.

A **Template** is a pre-made collection of blueprints that defines a
complete instance. For example, you might have a `postgres-only`
template for core development and a `postgres-postgis` template for
extension work. The `pgdev new` command uses these templates to
scaffold a new instance.

The tool also supports a **blueprint override system**. When you use a
template, **`pgdev`** will first look for blueprints in your personal
`~/pgdev/blueprints/` directory before falling back to the default
templates shipped with the tool in `~/pgdev/.core/templates/`.

## Installation

Installation is a two-step process: first install the core tool, then
configure your shell for seamless integration.

### Step 1: Install the Core Tool

Clone the repository and run the installer script. This will create the
`~/pgdev/.core` directory and copy the necessary files into it.

```bash
gh repo clone mschoema/pgdev
cd pgdev
./install.sh
````

### Step 2: Configure Shell Integration

To enable features like the `pgdev switch` command, you need to
integrate the tool with your shell.

#### For `fish` Users (Recommended)

The best experience for `fish` users is via a Fisher plugin. After
running the main `install.sh` script, install the plugin. The plugin
will automatically check that the core tool is installed.

```fish
# First, ensure you've run ./install.sh from the main repo
fisher install mschoema/pgdev-fish
```

#### For `bash` & `zsh` Users

For `bash` and `zsh`, add the following line to your startup file
(`.bashrc` for bash, `.zshrc` for zsh).

```bash
# Add this line to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
source "$HOME/pgdev/.core/shell/pgdev.sh.env"
```

After updating your shell file, open a new terminal to start using `pgdev`.

## Command Reference

### Instance Creation & Setup

  * **`pgdev create <name> --template <tmpl> [--port <num>]`**: The main all-in-one command. Scaffolds, builds, initializes, configures, and starts a new instance.
  * **`pgdev new <name> --template <tmpl>`**: Scaffolds a new instance directory and its blueprint scripts, but does *not* build it.
  * **`pgdev setup <name>`**: Runs the full `configure` and `build` chain for a scaffolded instance.

### Daily Management

  * **`pgdev list`**: Lists all instances, their status, port, and PostgreSQL version.
  * **`pgdev start [name]`**: Starts a stopped Postgres instance. Uses the active instance if `<name>` is omitted.
  * **`pgdev stop [name]`**: Stops a running Postgres instance.
  * **`pgdev restart [name]`**: Restarts an instance.
  * **`pgdev delete <name>`**: Stops and completely removes an instance directory.

### Shell Environment

  * **`pgdev switch <name>`**: Activates an instance for the current shell session by setting `PATH`, `PGDATA`, etc.
  * **`pgdev default <name>`**: Sets an instance as the default for all new shell sessions.

### Development & Interaction

  * **`pgdev build <name> <component>`**: Re-compiles a single component within an instance.
  * **`pgdev test <name> <component>`**: Runs the test suite for a single component.
  * **`pgdev psql [name]`**: Connects to the instance using `psql`.
  * **`pgdev logs [name]`**: Tails the main log file for the instance.

## Example Workflow ðŸŽ¬

1.  **Create your main work instance and set it as the default.**

    ```bash
    pgdev create pg17-main --template postgres-only
    pgdev default pg17-main
    ```

2.  **Open a new terminal.** Your default instance is automatically active.

    ```bash
    # No 'switch' needed! The prompt might even show the active instance.
    psql -c "SELECT version();"
    # version
    # ----------------------------------------------------
    # PostgreSQL 17devel ...
    ```

3.  **Create a separate instance to work on an extension.**

    ```bash
    pgdev create mobility-dev --template postgres-postgis-mobilitydb
    ```

4.  **Switch to the new instance for your current session.**

    ```bash
    pgdev switch mobility-dev
    # Switched to pgdev instance: mobility-dev
    ```

5.  **Edit extension code and quickly recompile just that component.**

    ```bash
    # (Make code changes in ~/pgdev/instances/mobility-dev/src/MobilityDB-...)
    pgdev build mobility-dev mobilitydb
    pgdev restart
    ```

-----

## Advanced Concepts

  * **`pgdev.conf`**: This file is auto-generated inside each instance after a successful build (e.g., `~/pgdev/instances/pg17-main/pgdev.conf`). It stores simple runtime metadata, primarily the **port** number and the PostgreSQL **version** string.

  * **`pgdev.manifest`**: This file is used as a communication channel between blueprints during the build process. It allows blueprints to declare runtime requirements. For example, the MobilityDB blueprint can write `requires_preload=postgis-3` to the manifest. The `pgdev create` command will later read this file and automatically configure `shared_preload_libraries` in `postgresql.conf`, making the blueprints self-describing and modular.

-----

## Uninstalling

To uninstall `pgdev`, you must remove the installed files and undo the shell integration.

1.  **Remove the core installation.**
    ```bash
    rm -rf ~/pgdev/.core
    ```
2.  **Remove the shell integration.**
      * For `fish` users: `fisher remove mschoema/pgdev-fish`.
      * For `bash`/`zsh` users: Remove the `source` line from your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.
3.  **Remove your blueprints (optional).**
    ```bash
    rm -rf ~/pgdev/blueprints
    ```

**Important**: This process does **not** touch your instance data located in `~/pgdev/instances/`. You must delete those directories manually if you no longer need them.
